#                                                            Hey there! My name's Morgan ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a software developer from Canada and I code because I love solving puzzles. Working with clients, figuring out their needs and finding solutions to their problems is the best part of my day to day. When I'm not working I enjoy hanging out with my cat, making and trying out new coffee, and I love to game! I love connecting and meeting new people in tech, so if you're reading this please feel free to send me an email about anything!
     
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on full-stack projects and client websites
- ðŸ¤” Learning anything and everything new that I can!
